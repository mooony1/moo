# Shipping & Fulfillment Guide

Everything you need to know about shipping for small to medium e-commerce stores.

## Carrier Comparison (UK)

| Carrier | Best For | Approx. Cost | Speed |
|---------|----------|--------------|-------|
| Royal Mail | Small, light items | £3-5 | 1-3 days |
| DPD | Tracked parcels | £5-8 | Next day |
| Evri (Hermes) | Budget option | £2-4 | 2-5 days |
| UPS | Heavy items | £8-15 | 1-2 days |
| FedEx | International | £15+ | 2-5 days |

## Packaging Tips

**Right-sizing matters**: Oversized boxes increase shipping costs and waste. Measure your most common products and stock 2-3 box sizes.

**Protection basics**:
- Bubble wrap for fragile items
- Kraft paper for void fill
- Double-box high-value items

**Branded packaging** (when ready):
- Custom tape is cheapest entry point
- Tissue paper adds perceived value
- Thank you cards increase repeat purchases

## Free Shipping Strategy

Free shipping increases conversion but costs money. Options:

1. **Threshold-based**: "Free shipping over £30" — set threshold just above average order value
2. **Built into price**: Increase product prices by £2-3, offer "free" shipping
3. **Members only**: Reserve for email subscribers or loyalty program
4. **Slow and free**: Offer free economy, charge for express

## Fulfillment Options

**Self-fulfillment**: Best when starting out. You control quality but it doesn't scale.

**3PL (Third-party logistics)**: Hand off storage and shipping. Consider when doing 100+ orders/month.

**Dropshipping**: Supplier ships direct. Lower margins but no inventory risk.

## Key Metrics to Track

- Cost per shipment
- Average delivery time
- Damage/return rate by carrier
- Shipping cost as % of revenue
